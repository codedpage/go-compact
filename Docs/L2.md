Excellent Manoj 👍

Since you have **14+ years experience** and are focusing on Golang, an **L2 interview** will expect:

* Strong Go fundamentals
* Concurrency deep understanding
* REST API + DB knowledge
* Basic system design
* Production-level thinking
* Code optimization
* Clean architecture knowledge

Now I’ll give you a **real L2-level preparation guide** with expected answers.

---

# 🔥 Golang L2 Interview Questions & Answers

---

# 🔹 1️⃣ Explain Goroutine Scheduling (Deep Question)

**Expected L2 Answer:**

Go uses **M:N scheduler model**:

* Many Goroutines (G)
* M OS Threads
* P (Processor) – manages execution context

The Go runtime schedules goroutines onto OS threads.

Key points:

* Cooperative scheduling
* Work-stealing algorithm
* Lightweight compared to threads

---

# 🔹 2️⃣ How do you prevent Race Conditions?

**Answer:**

Options:

* `sync.Mutex`
* `sync.RWMutex`
* Channels
* Atomic operations
* Avoid shared memory

Example:

```go
var mu sync.Mutex
mu.Lock()
counter++
mu.Unlock()
```

Also mention:

```
go run -race main.go
```

---

# 🔹 3️⃣ Mutex vs Channel — Which is Better?

**L2-Level Answer:**

* Use **Mutex** for protecting shared state.
* Use **Channel** for communication between goroutines.

Rule:

> “Do not communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating.”

But in high-performance systems, mutex is often faster.

---

# 🔹 4️⃣ Explain Context Package in Production

Very important for L2.

Uses:

* Request timeout
* Cancellation
* Deadline
* Passing request-scoped values

Example:

```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Second)
defer cancel()
```

Used heavily in:

* HTTP servers
* Microservices
* DB queries

---

# 🔹 5️⃣ How Does Garbage Collection Work in Go?

Go uses:

* Concurrent Mark and Sweep GC
* Low pause time
* Automatic memory management

Important:

* Avoid unnecessary allocations
* Reuse objects using `sync.Pool`

---

# 🔹 6️⃣ How Would You Design a REST API in Go?

Expected Answer Structure:

* Use `net/http` or framework (Gin/Fiber)
* Separate layers:

  * Handler
  * Service
  * Repository
* Use middleware for:

  * Logging
  * Authentication
  * Rate limiting
* Use context
* Return proper HTTP status codes

---

# 🔹 7️⃣ How Do You Structure a Production Go Project?

Example structure:

```
cmd/
internal/
  handler/
  service/
  repository/
pkg/
config/
```

Follow:

* Clean architecture
* Dependency injection via interfaces

---

# 🔹 8️⃣ How Do You Handle Errors in Large Systems?

Best Practices:

* Wrap errors using `fmt.Errorf("msg: %w", err)`
* Custom error types
* Avoid panic in production
* Centralized error handling

---

# 🔹 9️⃣ How to Optimize Go Application Performance?

Mention:

* Profiling using `pprof`
* Avoid unnecessary memory allocation
* Use connection pooling
* Use worker pools
* Avoid global locks
* Use buffered channels properly

---

# 🔹 🔟 Explain Worker Pool Pattern

Common L2 Question.

Used to limit number of goroutines.

Basic idea:

* Job channel
* Worker goroutines
* WaitGroup

Used in:

* Email sending
* Batch processing
* Background jobs

---

# 🔹 1️⃣1️⃣ How to Handle High Traffic APIs?

Expected Answer:

* Use connection pooling
* Use caching (Redis)
* Load balancing
* Graceful shutdown
* Timeout handling
* Rate limiting

---

# 🔹 1️⃣2️⃣ What Happens If You Close a Closed Channel?

Program will panic.

---

# 🔹 1️⃣3️⃣ What is Nil Interface Trap?

Very important L2 question.

```go
var err error = (*MyError)(nil)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Not nil")
}
```

Because interface holds:

* Type
* Value

Even if value is nil, type is not nil.

---

# 🔹 1️⃣4️⃣ Explain Dependency Injection in Go

Go doesn’t have framework like Spring.

We inject via interfaces:

```go
type UserService struct {
    repo UserRepository
}
```

Manual DI or use Wire (Google Wire).

---

# 🔹 1️⃣5️⃣ Graceful Shutdown in Go?

Important production question.

Steps:

* Listen for OS signals
* Use context cancellation
* Stop accepting new requests
* Wait for active requests to finish

---

# 🔥 Scenario-Based L2 Questions

---

### ❓ If 10,000 requests hit your API, what will you do?

Answer:

* Use connection pooling
* Add rate limiting
* Use worker pool
* Use caching
* Monitor using metrics
* Horizontal scaling

---

### ❓ If DB is slow, how do you fix?

* Add index
* Optimize query
* Add caching
* Reduce N+1 queries
* Use read replicas

---

# 🎯 What L2 Interviewer Checks

They check:

* Can you write production-ready code?
* Do you understand concurrency deeply?
* Can you debug issues?
* Do you know system behavior?
* Can you think about scalability?

---

# 🔥 Manoj-Specific Advice

Since you are:

* 14+ years experienced
* Backend focused

For L2, expect:

* Concurrency deep questions
* REST API design
* DB optimization
* Architecture thinking
* Some coding

If you want, I can now:

1️⃣ Take a **real L2 mock interview (live style Q&A)**
2️⃣ Give you a **Go L2 coding test**
3️⃣ Give you **Microservices design questions**
4️⃣ Prepare you for **Product-based company L2**

Tell me which type of company you're targeting:

* Service-based?
