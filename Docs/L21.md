Perfect Manoj 👍

For a **Service-based company L2 Golang interview**, the focus is usually:

* Strong fundamentals
* Clean coding
* Concurrency basics (not extremely deep like product companies)
* REST API development
* DB queries
* Debugging ability
* Client-facing mindset
* Ability to work on existing codebase

They check **stability + practical knowledge**, not hardcore distributed systems.

# 🔥 Service-Based Company – L2 Golang Interview Pattern

### Usually 3 Rounds:

1. Technical Round (Core Go + API + DB)
2. Practical / Coding Round
3. Managerial Round

---

# 🔹 Technical Round – Expected Questions

---

## 1️⃣ Explain your current Go project

Be ready to explain:

* What problem it solves
* Your role
* Tech stack
* DB used
* Traffic volume
* Challenges faced

Since you're experienced, answer in this structure:

> I worked on a backend microservice handling X requests per day.
> I implemented REST APIs, optimized DB queries, handled concurrency using goroutines and mutex, and implemented caching using Redis.

Keep it structured and confident.

---

## 2️⃣ How do you handle concurrency in Go?

Mention:

* Goroutines
* Channels
* Mutex
* WaitGroup
* Context

Explain where you used it in real project.

---

## 3️⃣ How do you handle errors in production?

Good L2 answer:

* Never panic in production
* Return proper HTTP status codes
* Log errors
* Wrap errors
* Centralized error handler middleware

---

## 4️⃣ How do you structure a Go project?

Example:

```
cmd/
internal/
  handler/
  service/
  repository/
  model/
config/
```

Mention:

* Separation of concerns
* Dependency injection
* Interface-based design

---

## 5️⃣ How do you connect to DB?

Expected:

```go
db, err := sql.Open("mysql", dsn)
```

Mention:

* Connection pooling
* Prepared statements
* Indexing
* Transactions

---

## 6️⃣ What is difference between Mutex and RWMutex?

* Mutex → single lock
* RWMutex → multiple readers, one writer

Use RWMutex when reads are more frequent.

---

## 7️⃣ How do you prevent memory leaks in Go?

Mention:

* Close channels
* Cancel context
* Close DB connections
* Avoid infinite goroutines

---

## 8️⃣ What is Context used for?

* Timeout
* Cancellation
* Request-scoped values

Very common in service companies.

---

# 🔹 Practical Coding Questions (Very Common)

---

### 1️⃣ Write API to create user

They expect:

* JSON parsing
* Validation
* DB insert
* JSON response
* Proper status code

---

### 2️⃣ Write function to find duplicates in array

Use map.

---

### 3️⃣ Write worker pool

Basic worker pool logic.

---

# 🔹 Scenario Questions (Very Important)

---

### ❓ API response is slow. What will you check?

Answer:

* DB query performance
* Indexes
* N+1 queries
* Network latency
* Logging time taken
* Add caching

---

### ❓ How do you handle 5000 concurrent requests?

Answer:

* Go handles concurrency well
* Use connection pooling
* Add rate limiting
* Use load balancer
* Use caching

Service companies LOVE this answer.

---

# 🔹 Managerial Round (Service Company Style)

They may ask:

* How do you handle client changes?
* How do you estimate timeline?
* How do you debug production issues?
* Have you worked directly with clients?

Answer confidently.

---

# 🔥 What Service Companies Look For in L2

They want:

✅ Stable developer
✅ Can work on existing code
✅ Understands debugging
✅ Can talk to client
✅ No ego
✅ Good communication

Not necessarily extreme system design.

---

# 🎯 Manoj Strategy for Service-Based L2

Since:

* You have 14+ years experience
* Backend exposure
* Golang + React knowledge

You should:

* Speak confidently
* Give real project examples
* Show problem-solving
* Don’t overcomplicate answers
