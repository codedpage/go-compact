Perfect Manoj 👍
For **L1 Golang interview**, focus will be on:

* Basics of Go syntax
* Goroutines & channels (basic understanding)
* Structs & interfaces
* REST API basics
* JSON handling
* Error handling
* Simple DB knowledge

They won’t go very deep into architecture.

# ✅ Golang L1 Interview Questions & Answers

---

## 🔹 1. Why did you choose Golang?

**Answer (professional style):**

> Go is simple, fast, and designed for concurrency.
> It compiles quickly, has built-in garbage collection, and is very suitable for backend services and microservices.

---

## 🔹 2. What is GOPATH and Go Modules?

* **GOPATH** → Old dependency management system
* **Go Modules** → Modern dependency management

```bash
go mod init myapp
go mod tidy
```

Use modules in all new projects.

---

## 🔹 3. Difference between Goroutine and Thread?

| Goroutine             | Thread        |
| --------------------- | ------------- |
| Lightweight           | Heavy         |
| Managed by Go runtime | Managed by OS |
| Thousands possible    | Limited       |

---

## 🔹 4. What happens if you don’t read from an unbuffered channel?

Program will **deadlock**.

Example:

```go
ch := make(chan int)
ch <- 10   // deadlock if no receiver
```

---

## 🔹 5. What is a Slice?

* Dynamic array
* Reference type

```go
s := []int{1,2,3}
```

Length and capacity are different.

---

## 🔹 6. What is the Zero Value in Go?

If variable not initialized, Go gives default value:

* int → 0
* string → ""
* bool → false
* pointer → nil

---

## 🔹 7. How does error handling work in Go?

Go uses **explicit error return**, not exceptions.

```go
file, err := os.Open("test.txt")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

---

## 🔹 8. What is defer?

Executes function after surrounding function returns.

Used for:

* Closing files
* Unlocking mutex
* Cleaning resources

---

## 🔹 9. Difference between make and new?

```go
new(int)      // returns pointer
make([]int,5) // initializes slice
```

`make` → for slice, map, channel
`new` → allocates memory

---

## 🔹 10. What is an Interface in Go?

Defines method signatures.

```go
type Animal interface {
    Speak() string
}
```

No `implements` keyword — implicit implementation.

# 🔹 Practical L1 Coding Questions

---

## 🔸 1. Reverse a string

```go
func reverse(s string) string {
    r := []rune(s)
    for i, j := 0, len(r)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
        r[i], r[j] = r[j], r[i]
    }
    return string(r)
}
```

---

## 🔸 2. Check if number is even or odd

```go
if num%2 == 0 {
    fmt.Println("Even")
}
```

---

## 🔸 3. Find duplicate elements in slice

Basic logic using map.

---

# 🔹 REST API Questions (Very Important)

---

## 1️⃣ How to create simple HTTP server?

```go
http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
```

---

## 2️⃣ How to parse JSON request?

```go
json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&data)
```

---

## 3️⃣ How to send JSON response?

```go
json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(response)
```

---

## 🔹 Database Question (Basic)

Q: How do you connect to MySQL/Postgres?

Using `database/sql` package.

```go
db, err := sql.Open("mysql", "dsn")
```

# 🔥 Most Common L1 Interview Trap Questions

---

### ❓ What is nil in Go?

Nil is zero value for:

* pointer
* slice
* map
* channel
* interface

---

### ❓ Can map be accessed concurrently?

❌ No.
Use:

* sync.Mutex
  or
* sync.Map

---

### ❓ What is difference between concurrency and parallelism?

* Concurrency → Managing multiple tasks
* Parallelism → Running tasks simultaneously

---

# 🎯 How to Answer in L1 Interview

Since you are 14+ years experienced, keep answers:

* Clear
* Short
* Confident
* Practical examples

Don’t over-explain theory.
