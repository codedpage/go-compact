HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by a server in response to an HTTP request made by a client (usually a web browser). 
These codes provide information about the result of the request and indicate whether it was successful, encountered an error, 
or requires further action by the client. Here are some common HTTP status codes and their meanings:

1xx - Informational
- **100 Continue**: The server has received the request headers and the client can proceed with the request.

2xx - Successful
- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested data.
- **201 Created**: The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource has been created.
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there is no data to return (typically used for successful DELETE requests).

3xx - Redirection
- **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found (or 303 See Other)**: The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URL. The client should use the new URL for future requests.
- **304 Not Modified**: The client's cached copy of the resource is still valid, and there's no need to re-download it.

4xx - Client Errors
- **400 Bad Request**: The server cannot understand the client's request, often due to malformed syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required, and the client's request lacks valid credentials.
- **403 Forbidden**: The client does not have permission to access the requested resource.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: The client has exceeded rate limits for the given resource.

5xx - Server Errors
- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is temporarily unable to handle the request due to overloading or maintenance.
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: The server, acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.

These are some of the most commonly encountered HTTP status codes, but there are many more. When a client (e.g., a web browser) receives an HTTP status code, it can interpret the code to understand the result of its request and take appropriate action, such as displaying an error message or following a redirection.
